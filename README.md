# Buildkite-demo

Buildkite agents are small, reliable and cross-platform build runners that run automated builds. Buildkite never accesses your code, and does not run any agents, so you need to install and run agents on your own infrastructure. You can do this on your local development machine, an existing CI machine, or a new server.

1] Follow the Agent installation instructions to install and start an agent.

2] Make sure you've configured the agent token, as that is what connects the agent to your Buildkite account. Refer to Buildkite Agent Configuration for more information.

3] Opt in to the YAML steps editor. This is the newer way of configuring pipelines. Refer to Pipeline Upgrade - Using YAML Steps for new pipelines for more information.
